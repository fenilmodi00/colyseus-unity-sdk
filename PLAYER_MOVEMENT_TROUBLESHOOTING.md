# Player Movement Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue Summary
Your Unity player movement wasn't working due to two main issues:

1. **Network Connection Failure**: The Colyseus server isn't running or doesn't have the "akash_demo" room configured
2. **Multiple PlayerMovement Scripts**: Multiple instances were being created and causing conflicts

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed PlayerMovement.cs
- **Added offline mode support**: Player movement now works even without network connection
- **Added null safety checks**: Prevents NullReferenceExceptions when network fails
- **Added duplicate prevention**: Only one PlayerMovement instance is allowed
- **Improved error handling**: Better logging and graceful failure recovery

### 2. Fixed AkashDemoSceneSetup.cs
- **Prevented duplicate player creation**: Checks if PlayerMovement already exists before creating new one

## üéÆ How to Test Player Movement

### Option 1: Test Offline Movement (Recommended)
1. **Start Unity and run your scene**
2. **Click anywhere in the game view** - the player should move to that position
3. **Hold Shift + Click** - the player should move towards the Akash logo (red square)
4. **Check the console** - you should see movement debug messages like:
   ```
   Akash Demo: Moving to (x, y)
   Akash Demo: Moving towards Akash logo!
   ```

### Option 2: Fix Network Connection (Advanced)
If you want multiplayer functionality, you need to:

1. **Install and run a Colyseus server** that supports the "akash_demo" room
2. **Create a Colyseus server setup** with the following room configuration:
   ```typescript
   // Example server code needed
   import { Room } from "colyseus";
   
   export class AkashDemoRoom extends Room {
     onCreate() {
       this.maxClients = 10;
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Register the room** in your server as "akash_demo"

## üîß Current Player Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Left Click** | Move player to clicked position |
| **Shift + Left Click** | Move player towards Akash logo |
| **Tab** | Toggle UI (if UIManager is working) |
| **H** | Toggle instructions (if UIManager is working) |

## üöÄ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Player object appears in scene (blue circle)
- [ ] Clicking moves the player smoothly
- [ ] Shift+clicking moves toward the red Akash logo
- [ ] Console shows movement debug messages
- [ ] No NullReferenceExceptions in console

## üêõ If Movement Still Doesn't Work

1. **Check the Scene Hierarchy**: Look for a "Player" GameObject with PlayerMovement component
2. **Verify Camera Setup**: Make sure you have a Camera tagged as "MainCamera"
3. **Check Console for Errors**: Look for any remaining errors or warnings
4. **Test in Play Mode**: Movement only works when Unity is in Play mode

## üìù Technical Changes Made

### PlayerMovement.cs Changes:
- Enhanced `Awake()` method with duplicate detection
- Modified `Start()` method with offline mode support  
- Improved `HandleInput()` with better debugging
- Added comprehensive error handling in `registerListeners()`

### AkashDemoSceneSetup.cs Changes:
- Added duplicate check in `SetupPlayerMovement()`
- Improved player creation logic

The player movement should now work in offline mode regardless of network connection status!
