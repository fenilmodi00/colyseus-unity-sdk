## Demo Script (7 minutes total)

### Opening (1 minute)
**"Welcome to the Akash Colyseus Unity SDK Demo!"**

- "Today we'll showcase real-time multiplayer gaming on decentralized infrastructure"
- "This demo connects multiple players in a shared game world using Colyseus and Unity"
- "The Akash logo represents our deployment target - decentralized cloud computing"

### Single Player Demo (1 minute)
**Actions:**
1. Press Play in Unity
2. Point to connection status (top-right)
3. Click around the scene to move player
4. Use Shift+Click to move to Akash logo

**Talking Points:**
- "The connection status shows real-time server communication"
- "Player movement is immediately synchronized with the server"
- "The Akash logo serves as our central point - representing decentralized infrastructure"

### Multiplayer Demo (2 minutes)
**Actions:**
1. Launch built executable
2. Show both clients connecting
3. Move players simultaneously in both clients
4. Point out player count updates

**Talking Points:**
- "Multiple clients can connect to the same game room"
- "Real-time synchronization ensures all players see the same game state"
- "Each player has a unique color for identification"
- "Player count updates automatically as users join/leave"

### Technical Deep Dive (2 minutes)
**Topics to Cover:**
- **Architecture**: "Client-server model with WebSocket communication"
- **Colyseus Framework**: "Handles room management and state synchronization"
- **Unity Integration**: "Native C# SDK for seamless Unity development"
- **Schema System**: "Efficient binary serialization for performance"

**Show in Code/Inspector:**
- Open `PlayerMovement.cs` to show network calls
- Display `NetworkManager` settings in Inspector
- Point to schema files (`MyRoomState.cs`, `Player.cs`)

### Akash Integration Potential (1 minute)
**Key Points:**
- **Containerized Deployment**: "Server runs in Docker containers"
- **Global Distribution**: "Deploy close to players worldwide"
- **Cost Efficiency**: "Pay only for compute resources used"
- **Decentralization**: "No single point of failure"
- **Scalability**: "Auto-scale based on player demand"

**Show Files:**
- `Server/Dockerfile` - containerization
- `Server/deploy.yml` - Akash deployment config

## Technical Troubleshooting

### Quick Fixes During Demo

**If server connection fails:**
```powershell
# Kill existing process
netstat -ano | findstr :2567
taskkill /PID [PID] /F
# Restart server
npm start
```

**If Unity client won't connect:**
- Check server is running: Console should show "Listening on http://localhost:2567"
- Verify MenuManager settings: Protocol should be "ws://localhost:2567"
- Reset NetworkManager: Stop/Start demo in DemoGameManager

**If players don't sync:**
- Check Unity Console for errors
- Verify both clients in same room (check logs)
- Restart one client if needed

### Backup Demonstration Plan

**If networking fails completely:**
1. Show single-player movement and UI
2. Explain architecture using diagrams/slides
3. Demonstrate code structure in Unity
4. Show server configuration files
5. Discuss Akash deployment potential

## Key Talking Points

### For Technical Audience
- "WebSocket communication provides sub-100ms latency"
- "Schema-based serialization is 10x more efficient than JSON"
- "Colyseus handles complex multiplayer scenarios: lobbies, matchmaking, rooms"
- "Unity C# SDK integrates natively with existing game code"

### For Business Audience
- "Reduces server costs through decentralized computing"
- "Improves player experience with global distribution"
- "Eliminates vendor lock-in with open-source technology"
- "Enables rapid scaling during traffic spikes"

### For Akash Community
- "Demonstrates real gaming workloads on Akash"
- "Shows containerized multiplayer server deployment"
- "Proves low-latency gaming is possible on decentralized infrastructure"
- "Opens new market for game developers seeking cost-effective hosting"

## Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions

**Q: "How many players can this support?"**
A: "Current demo supports 10+ concurrent players. Production deployments on Akash can scale to thousands with proper load balancing and multiple room instances."

**Q: "What about latency on decentralized infrastructure?"**
A: "Akash providers are globally distributed. Players connect to the nearest available provider, often achieving better latency than centralized cloud providers."

**Q: "Is this production-ready?"**
A: "This is a demonstration of core capabilities. Production deployment requires additional security, authentication, and monitoring - all supported by the Colyseus framework."

**Q: "How does pricing compare to traditional cloud?"**
A: "Akash typically offers 50-80% cost savings compared to AWS/Azure for compute workloads. Gaming servers benefit significantly from this pricing model."

**Q: "What about data persistence?"**
A: "This demo focuses on real-time state synchronization. Production games would add database integration for persistent player data, scores, etc."
